Project Details:

In this project, we try to see how page replacement works, mainly(LRU) and understand
the working of the page hits, tlb hits, miss rates and how to achieve  the best outcome 
using LRU. We see how the computer converts logical to physical address.

The Project has been coded in C language.

Running the Application:

Build final.c, this will generate the output file required for execution

Execute the file with adresses.txt

This will generate an output file which will contain the Virtual address, Physiccal address
and will output the hit rates, miss rates and total number of adresses translated.
